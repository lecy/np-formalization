The nonprofit organizational life cycle literature has traditionally focused on the
entry and exit processes; the intermediate organizational life stages between these
bookends have received less attention. Almost half of all nonprofits at any given time
operate in an early life stage with less than US$100,000 in revenue, minimal overhead
spending, and no paid managers. This study examines the process by which nonprofits
leave the small, informal, startup phase and begin the next life stage characterized
by growth and formalization. We identify financial and organizational characteristics
that predict whether the nonprofit will successfully transition out of the early and
informal life stage. We find that investments in professional fundraising and access
to government funds are predictive of the transition out of the start-up phase, while
traditional financial predictors such as revenue concentration, equity ratio, fixed cost
ratios, and the accumulation of unrestricted assets have modest to no effects.
